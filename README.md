15THRAILGRINDER
===============

An attempt to combine two different apps and incude a multi node and form it into a web site.
Going from windows and moving it to GitHub has been difficult but is possible.

Rail-Grinder is an open source miner that works without having to be stuck to any one pool/mine. you chose where
you want to mine,you can change mines at will and be able to mine on your own as - solo miner.

With Bitcoin becomming more difficult to find the Rail-Grinder gives you the ability to mine for many other 
"cryptocurrencies".

This programme will unlock all the restrictions and open the world of cryptocurrencies to you. 
for me it makes mining more fun and proffitable

The above is the aim of Rail-Grinder but please note that its down to the driver to use it correctly when digging around for all those blocks and/or coins, the main thing though is "HAVE SOME FUN MINING THAT MONEY"
